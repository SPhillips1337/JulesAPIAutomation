Amazon Q Developer identified one final logic error in PR #1. Your current check for `$output === null` in `app.php` only catches configuration errors, not script crashes. 

Please update the logic to capture the exit code by appending `; echo $?` to the command and parsing the result. 

Example fix for `app.php`:
```php
$output = shell_exec($cmd . ' 2>&1; echo $?');
$lines = explode("\n", trim($output));
$exit_code = array_pop($lines);
if ($exit_code !== '0') {
    throw new Exception('Failed to execute  script');
}
```

This ensures we don't proceed with missing or corrupt data if the Python script fails.
